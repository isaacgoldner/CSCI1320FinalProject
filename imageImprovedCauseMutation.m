function mutatedChildren = imageImprovedCauseMutation(children)

%this function deals with task 2.3's requirements for developing a more
%refined mutation process. 

%randomly pick a collection of pixels within a randomly selected set of
%children from the children population: 

%For each child selected to be mutated... 

%with a specified "random mutation rate", assign certain pixels an entirely
%random value, but others a new mutated value that is within a specified
%mutation range. This is designed to eliminate "trouble spots" that would
%be otherwise difficult to remove via sheerly random mutations.
