function mutatedChild = imageImprovedCauseMutation(child)

%this function deals with task 2.3's requirements for developing a more
%refined mutation process. 

%randomly pick a collection of pixels

%with a specified "random mutation rate", assign certain pixels an entirely
%random value, but others a new mutated value that is within a specified
%mutation range. This is designed to eliminate "trouble spots" that would
%be otherwise difficult to remove via sheerly random mutations.
