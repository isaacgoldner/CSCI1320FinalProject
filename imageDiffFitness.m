function fitness = imageDiffFitness(population)

%using the diff function, we will determine the rate of change of each
%pixel in four different directions as required (up,down,left,right) for 
%each image, and then compare each of 
%these values for each of the pixels on both images, with a specific 
%tolerance value, to determine each organism's fitness

%the total fitness values will be kept between 0 and 1 by adding them in
%the quadrature process shown in the assignment sheet.
