function fitness = imageDiffFitness(population)

%using the diff function, we will determine the rate of change of each
%pixel (up,down,left,right) for each image, and then compare each of 
%these values for each of the pixels on both images, with a specific 
%tolerance value, to determine each organisms' fitness

%the total fitness values will be kept between 0 and 1 by adding them in
%quadrature
