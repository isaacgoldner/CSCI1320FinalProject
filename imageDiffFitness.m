function fitness = imageDiffFitness(ImgePopulation)

%using the diff function, we will determine the rate of change of each
%pixel in four different directions as required (up,down,left,right) for 
%each image, and then compare each of 
%these values for each of the pixels on both images, with a specific 
%tolerance value, to determine each organism's fitness

%the total fitness values for the organisms will be kept between 0 and 1 by adding them in
%the quadrature process shown in the assignment sheet. 

%The fitness of a given generation's input population will be stored in a
%vector, one element per each organism's fitness.
