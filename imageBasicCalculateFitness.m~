function fitness = imageBasicCalculateFitness(population)

%calculate the fitness of each of the random images
%for this basic fitness function, the fitness is calculated based on if the
%pixel matches the exact value of the target image

%raise the fitnesses of each of the random images to a specified
%exponential factor in order to differentiate the fitnesses more

%in task 2.2, we will improve this fitness function by adding a tolerance
%value, so that the random image pixe
