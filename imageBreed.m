function children = imageBreed(matingPool)

%breed randomly selected "parent" organism pairs from the mating pool
%population with a specific method of taking random
%DNA (which are represented with individual pixels) from each of the 
%individual parents. 

%function returns a set of children that after mutation in some cases will
%become the next generation in the evolution process.
