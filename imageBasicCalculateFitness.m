function fitness = imageBasicCalculateFitness(ImagePopulation)

%calculate the fitness of each of the random images
%for this basic fitness function, the fitness is calculated based on how
%closely the pixels of the organism match the pixels of the target image.
%We anticipate expressing fitness as a percent. 

%raise the fitnesses of each of the random images to a specified
%exponential factor in order to differentiate the fitnesses more in order
%to eventually decide which members of the population will enter the mating
%pool to form the next generation. 

%For a given generation's input population, "fitness" will be a vector 
%where each element will corrispond to an organism's fitness.
