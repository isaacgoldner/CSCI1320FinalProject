function mutatedChild = causeMutation(children)
%Using the newly created population of children, this function
%takes in a "child" string and mutates it with a certain mutation rate

%specify the mutation rate (this may be changed to optimize the program): 
mutationRate = .01;

%We antipate using a random number generator and conditional statements
%to decide if a child is to be mutated. If a child is to be mutated,
%another process is used to do so. 
mutatedChild = 'mutated string';

%By the end of this process a random number of children in the new
%population will have been mutated.
