%A random number generator combined with a conditional statement based
%around the the value of the random number generated will be
%used to determine if a child is mutated at all: 

%Note: the mutation rate will be specified as a variable that can be
%altered to minimize evolution times. 

%if a child is to be mutated...

%randomly select a collection of pixels to mutate

%assign each of the pixels a new random value. 

%By the end of this process a random number of members of the population of
%the children have been randomly mutated.
